# We got 99 problems, but blockchain aint one

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that **crypto can be frustrating**. Prices go up and down, hacks happen, and new projects seem to pop up every day. But despite all of the chaos and volatility, there's something about crypto that keeps us coming back for more. In this blog post, I'll explore some of the most common problems that cryptocurrency enthusiasts face, and I'll offer some advice to help you deal spot them.

### The crypto market is extremely volatile and risky

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crypto market is indeed a volatile and risky place. Not only do you have to deal with the high price volatility of cryptocurrencies, but you also have to be aware of bad actors, scammers, and hackers who might try to steal your cryptocurrencies or NFTs. There have been numerous hacks of cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets over the years, resulting in the loss of billions of dollars worth of digital assets. This is one of the major risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies. Another risk is that of fraud and scams. There have been many cases where people have been defrauded by fake ICOs, NFT hype shilling, and pyramid schemes masquerading as legitimate investments.

### Most crypto projects are not well-conceived or executed

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of crypto projects are not well-conceived or executed. This is especially true in NFT roadmap projects, where they drive up hype by promising features that are not yet developed or by clasping onto popular trends. Many of these projects end up being nothing more than smoke and mirrors, and their creators often disappear with the funds raised, because, why wouldn't they? They already got their money. Even when projects are successfully completed, they often fail to live up to the hype. This is due to a number of factors, including incompetence, fraud, poor management, but most importantly, there is not incentive to deliever... They've already been paid!.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, investors should be cautious when considering investing in any project. In particular, they should research the team behind the project and carefully evaluate the feasibility of the roadmap. Otherwise, they risk losing their investment to another failed crypto experiment. Is the team doxxed? Have they had success in the past? Does the team have a competitive advantage?

### The vast majority of projects will fail

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This isn't necessarily a bad thing; after all, experimentation is essential for any industry to grow and thrive. Yes, its true, we are in the midst of a bear market, and the vast majority of projects will not survive. We are seeing the death of the hype-driven projects and the rise of true builders and creators. The projects that are built on solid foundations and have real use cases are the ones that will thrive in this market. The those that are built on empty promises and hype will quickly fade away. This is a necessary process to weed out the weak projects and make room for the strong ones. The current market conditions are tough, but they are also giving us an opportunity to build a stronger, more sustainable industry.

### However, there are a few gems to be found in the sea of trash

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A "bear market" is when the price of an asset falls over a sustained period of time. For crypto, this typically happens when there is a sell-off or negative news that drives prices down, or... [Elon Musk tweets](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/culture-week/2021/12/14/the-elon-effect-how-musks-tweets-move-crypto-markets/). However, bear markets are nothing new and tend to happen in all markets. The important thing for investors is to remember that prices will rebound. When they do, those that have researched and invested well will see the biggest returns. We will see strong teams and projects that are ready to scale will emerge during bull markets. So, if you want to set yourself up for exciting returns, make sure to research and invest in quality projects during bear markets. That way, you'll be positioned for success when the market turns around.

### Its a wild place full of unrealised potential

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current crypto market is a Wild West of volatility and risk. Most projects are not well-conceived or executed, and the vast majority will fail. **_However_**, there are a few gems to be found in the sea of trash. Do your research and learn how to spot a hype project from something real. With that knowledge, you can make sound investment decisions and find projects with true potential for growth.
