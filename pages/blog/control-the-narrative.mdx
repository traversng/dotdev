# Control the narrative | CheckBlock

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As **crypto** _builders_, _fans_, and _users_ we have the power to control the narrative around blockchain technology. By creating tools that are easy to use and accessible to everyone, we can create a world where people trust blockchain technology and see its potential. CheckBlock is one such tool, and it's my hope that it will help pave the way for wider adoption of blockchain technology. CheckBlock protects you from malicious websites, hacks, and phishing attacks. The Web App and Browser Extension work together to keep you safe online. [Use CheckBlock](https://checkblock.xyz) to help control the narrative around blockchain technology!

## What inspired me to create CheckBlock

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Coinbase, I had started a few projects with friends but eventually pulled the plug on them because they didn't feel innovative or useful and I didn't want to contribute to the problem with 99% of the projects out there. One thing was for certain: there were plenty of hacks and nfts being stolen from crypto wallets. After almost connecting my wallet on a malicious site, that was one character different than the main mint site, I decided its time to tackle this head-on!

## How it works and what benefits it offers

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Users need safe and reliable tools to protect their assets and **CheckBlock** provides just that. The **CheckBlock** [Browser Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/checkblockxyz/gaaphegpgplgkpfmpiiedjhhfpmhfacc) and [Web App](https://checkblock.xyz) work together to keep users informed about the latest scams and hacks in the Crypto world.

## The future of CheckBlock and how you can be a part of it

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project is still very new, and we need your help to build the database of domains both safe and unsafe. You can contribute by adding domains on the [site](https://checkblock.xyz) so that we all stay protected from nft theft or phishing attacks! The community has plans for a DAO soon which converts this into truly decentralized development.
