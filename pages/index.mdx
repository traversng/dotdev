# Travis Ueki

## I write software and build things with my keyboard.

I have been building software professionally since graduating from a [coding bootcamp](https://learningfuze.com) in 2015. Before that I was in the Navy stationed in San Diego.

I am passionate about Web3 Technologies and the Blockchain ecosystem. Most recently created I have been working on a product [CheckBlock.xyz](https://checkblock.xyz)
that protects Crypto and NFT enthusiasts from malicious websites and phishing attempts.
More information on [CheckBlock.xyz](https://checkblock.xyz) can be found [here](https://docs.checkblock.xyz).
